# MarketMonkey
They say that a monkey throwing darts at a dartboard with different stocks on it will yield about the same or better results as an experienced broker picking an undiversified portfolio, well I decided to put that to the test against the Forbes top 10 stocks for 2020, published on December 31, 2019. Though I didn't beat it on my first generation of 10 socks, the 10 stocks this 'monkey' picked only lost by 1.8%. View the results here: https://inflationhedging.com/predicting-the-stock-market/

## As Easy as It Seems
This program picks randomly from the list of over 8000 stocks trading in US markets. All you need to do is change the variable "stockPicks" to the number of stocks you want your monkey to pick.

It should be noted that this program uses the JSON in Java library (org.json) and should be used when compiling this program, it is available for free download from Maven here: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json/20190722
